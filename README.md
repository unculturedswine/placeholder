placeholder
===========

A simple, customizable jQuery placeholder solution.

This does not require the use of the input 'placeholder' value, but rather uses a 'label' to act as a placeholder positioned via CSS.

In order for this to work properly, your 'label' and 'input' will need to be inside a containing element (p, div, etc).
Set the CSS Property 'position' to 'relative' (position: relative;) on the containing element, and set the 'label' to 'position: absolute'. 
You will need to use your own CSS to place the 'label' in an area that looks good with your design.
